# Rad-cGAN v1.0: Radar-based precipitation nowcasting model with conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for multiple dam domains



## Introduction

Here is the cGAN-based precipitation nowcasting model, named Rad-cGAN, was trained with a radar reflectivity map of the Soyang-gang Dam region in South Korea with a spatial domain of 128 Ã— 128 km, spatial resolution of 1 km, and temporal resolution of 10 min provided by Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) .

The source code of Rad-cGAN was written using [Keras](https://keras.io/)  functional API is in the folder `model`.

The pre-trained Rad-cGAN model is avilable in Zenodo:
